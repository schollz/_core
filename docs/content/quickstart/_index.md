# Quickstart

### on & off

First switch the top right switch "up" to turn on the device. The device should, by default, be loaded with several samples. A sample should start immediately playing. You can jump around in the sample by pressing any of the `1-16` keys. Try retriggering samples by pressing and holding a `1-16` key and then pressing a different `1-16` key.

### volume & tempo

Change the [volume](#volume) by holding the `A` key (top left key) and turning `Knob Z` (the knob on the righthand side). Similarly, change the [tempo](#tempo) by holding the `A` key and then turning `Knob Y`.

### banks & samples

There are 16 banks of samples, and each bank can hold 16 samples. You are currently in the first bank and the first sample. To change to a different bank and different sample you can do this button combo: first hold `B` and then, while holding `B`, press `1-16` to select a bank. Continue to hold the `B` key and now press another button `1-16` to select the sample.

## effects & modes

The device starts up in `JUMP` mode. When pressing `1-16` you are jumping samples. But you can also toggle effects by holding `A` and then pressing `1-16` to toggle that effect. There are [16 different effects](#effect-list). If you don't want to hold down the `A` key each time, you can enter the `MASH` mode which lets you mash effect toggles. Enter the `MASH` mode by holding down `A` and then pressing `C`. Now you can toggle effects just by pressing `1-16`, without holding any keys. Hold `A` and press `B` to go back to the `JUMP` mode behavior.

## effect parameters & probabilities

Each effect has up to two parameters that can be edited, and each effect also has a probability. To modify the effect parameters, first go into `MASH` mode (`A` + `C`). Now, in `MASH` mode, hold down the effect you want to edit. For example, hold down `2` to edit the `LOSS` effect. While holding down the effect, turn `Knob X` or `Knob Y` to change the parameters for that effect. You can find more information about each parameter in the effect reference below. For example, [loss](#loss) has "loss type" and "loss amount" that can be edited. For each effect, `Knob Z` will raise the probability that the given effect will toggle randomly.

## adding samples & updating firmware

Turn off the device and take out the microSD card. You can upload samples directly to the SD card, though the samples need to be pre-processed. You can use [the online tool](/tool) to process your samples, or [download the tool](#uploading-samples) to use it offline. Updating the firmware is straightforward - you can download a new release and upload it via a USB-C cable. Follow [these instructions for uploading firmwares](#uploading-firmware) to upload to a new firmware.

## everything else

For pretty much everything else, consult this guide or just use the [handy reference guide](#reference) which has all the button combinations and effect list at a glance.
