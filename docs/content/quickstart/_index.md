# Quickstart

### on & off

To power on the device, toggle the switch on the top right to the "up" position. The device comes pre-loaded with several samples. A sample will start playing automatically. Navigate through the samples by pressing any of the `1-16` keys. Experiment with retriggering samples by pressing and holding one `1-16` key and then pressing a different `1-16` key.

### volume & tempo

Adjust the [volume](#volume) by holding the `A` key (top left key) and turning `Knob Z` located on the right-hand side. Similarly, modify the [tempo](#tempo) by holding the `A` key and turning `Knob Y`.

### banks & samples

There are 16 banks of samples, with each bank capable of holding 16 samples. By default, you are in the first bank and the first sample. To switch to a different bank and select a different sample, follow these steps: first, hold `B`, then while holding `B`, press `1-16` to choose a bank. Keep the `B` key pressed and then press another `1-16` button to select a sample within that bank.

## effects & modes

The device powers up in `JUMP` mode, where pressing `1-16` allows you to navigate through samples. In addition to sample jumping, you can toggle effects by holding `A` and then pressing `1-16` to activate the selected effect. There are [16 different effects](#effect-list) to choose from. If you prefer not to hold down the `A` key for each effect selection, you can switch to `MASH` mode. To enter `MASH` mode, hold `A` and press `C`. In this mode, you can toggle effects simply by pressing `1-16`, without the need to hold any keys. To return to the default `JUMP` mode behavior, hold `A` and press `B`.

## effect parameters & probabilities

Each effect can be customized with up to two parameters and features a probability setting. To adjust the effect parameters, enter `MASH` mode by pressing (`A` + `C`). While in `MASH` mode, press and hold the effect you wish to edit. For instance, hold down `2` to modify the `LOSS` effect. While holding the effect, use `Knob X` or `Knob Y` to tweak the parameters for that effect. Detailed information about each parameter can be found in the effect reference section below. For example, [loss](#loss) allows adjustments to "loss type" and "loss amount." To modify the likelihood of the effect occurring randomly, use `Knob Z`.


## adding samples & updating firmware

To add samples, power off the device and remove the microSD card. Samples must be pre-processed before uploading them directly to the SD card. You can utilize [the online tool](/tool) for sample processing or opt to [download the tool](#uploading-samples) for offline use. Updating the firmware is simple - download a new release and upload it using a USB-C cable. Follow the provided [instructions for uploading firmware](#uploading-firmware) to complete the process and install the new firmware.

## everything else

For any additional information, refer to this guide or utilize the [handy reference guide](#reference) which provides quick access to button combinations and the effect list for easy reference.
