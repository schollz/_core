To change samples, you can hold **B** and press **1-16** to select a bank. While still holding **B**, press another **1-16** to select the sample. The current sample will be instantly faded out (within 10 ms), and the next sample will load at the position where the current sample is playing.

Alternatively, you can use the knobs to change samples - **C** + **X** will change to any sample.
