The Tempo feature offers dual methods for precision tempo control.

First, you can adjust dynamically by holding **A** and rotating **Knob X**â€”with the middle position representing the original BPM, turning fully clockwise for double speed, and turning fully counter-clockwise for half speed.

Secondly, you can hold **A** and tap **B** to manually tap in the tempo, which ranges from 30 to 300 BPM.

In both methods, the newly set tempo is briefly displayed, providing immediate visual confirmation of adjustments. This feature ensures that users can easily synchronize their audio to the desired pace.
