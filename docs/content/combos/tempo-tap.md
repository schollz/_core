The Tempo feature offers three methods for precision tempo control.

First, you can adjust dynamically by holding **A** and rotating **Knob X**â€”with the middle position representing the original BPM, turning fully clockwise for double speed, and turning fully counter-clockwise for half speed.

Secondly, you can hold **A** and tap **B** to manually tap in the tempo, which ranges from 30 to 300 BPM.

In both methods, the newly set tempo is briefly displayed, providing immediate visual confirmation of adjustments. This feature ensures that users can easily synchronize their audio to the desired pace.

Thirdly, you can press and hold **A**, and then hold **B**, and then tap any of the keys, 1-16 to set the tempo to a pre-defined value. This is useful for quickly setting the tempo to a common value.
