Sequences can be combined into "chains" of sequences, which are saved as new sequences that can be recalled or further chained into new sequences.

To create a sequence chain, follow these steps:

1. Press and hold the `C` key (the sequence selector). Lit buttons indicate where sequences are stored, while unlit buttons signify empty slots.
2. *While holding down the `C` key*, press an unlit button to select the sequence slot where the new chain sequence will be stored.
3. *While still holding down the `C` key*, press the lit buttons with existing sequences in any order to create the sequence chain.
4. Release the `C` key, and the sequence chain will be automatically generated and saved in the slot chosen in step #2.

If there are no free slots available, you cannot create sequence chains. In such cases, you can delete a sequence by [selecting it](#select-sequence) (`C` + `1-16`) and then [deleting it](#record-sequence) (`C` + `D`).
