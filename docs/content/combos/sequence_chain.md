Sequences can be arbitrarily combined into "chains" of sequences. Sequence chains are permanently saved as new sequences which can be later recalled or further chained into new sequences.

To create a sequence chain follow these steps:

1. Hold down the `C` key (the sequence selector). While holding down the `C` key you will see lit buttons where sequences are stored and unlit buttons where there is no sequence.
2. *While holding down the `C` key*, press an unlit button where there is no sequence stored. This is the sequence slot where the new chain sequence will be stored.
3. *While continuing to hold down the `C` key*, press any lit buttons that has a sequence, in any order or sequence. This is the sequence chain.
4. Finally, let go of the `C` key and your sequence will automatically be generated and saved in the slot you chose in #2.

If you do not have any free slots you cannot chain sequences. In these cases, you can delete a sequence by [selecting it](#select-sequence) (`C` + `1-16`) and then [deleting it](#record-sequence) (`C` + `D`).
