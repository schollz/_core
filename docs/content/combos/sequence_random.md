Turning this knob fully CCW will allow the full sequence to play. Turning the knob fully CW will create a new random sequence in the current sample. Turning the knob in between both ends will adjust the number of steps available to the random sequence. 

The random sequence can be re-rolled by turning fully CW. You can also re-roll a single random step by holding **B** and pressing **A**.
