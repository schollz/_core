Tempo matching involves adjusting the playback speed of a sample by a multiplier to align with the ratio between the sample's BPM (set in the [tool](https://tool.zeptocore.com)) and the BPM of the current tempo in Zeptocore. Typically, this adjustment is configured per sample when loading samples onto Zeptocore, but it can also be adjusted on the fly.

When enabled, the Tempo Match mode will show `MATCH ON`, and when disabled, it will display `MATCH OFF`.

This setting can be customized on a file-by-file basis using the [tool](/tool).
