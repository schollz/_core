Activating this combo will create a random sequence that will be used in place of the current sequence (whether is from sequencing or normal playback). (*Requires v2.5.+* version of the firmware). [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqEQhTOjhSM).

If this is activated with [random fill](#random-fill), then a new sequence will automatically be generated every 32 beats.

If this is activated, holding down and pressing any of the **1-16** keys will automatically generate a new sequence of that length.

*New in v2.7.4*: If this is activated, holding down **B** and pressing **A** will swap out a random entry in the sequence for another random entry.
