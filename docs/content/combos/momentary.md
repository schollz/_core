By default, the [`MASH` mode](#mode-mash) will let you turn on and off effects by pressing the buttons to toggle them. You can change this toggling behavior to a momentary press behavior by using this combo. Press **1**+**4**+**16**+**13** to switch between momentary and toggling FX in `MASH` mode. The screen will show `MOMENTARY` when momentary mode is enabled. When in momentary mode, the effects will only be active while the button is pressed.
