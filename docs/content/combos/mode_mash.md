There are three possible modes: [jump](#jump-mode), [mash](#mash-mode), and [bass](#bass-mode). 

In the `MASH` mode, pressing in the **1-16** will toggle [effects](#effects) on and off depending on where you press. If you want to have the effects only active while the button is pressed, you can switch to [momentary mode](#momentary-fx-mode) by pressing **1**+**4**+**13**+**16**.
