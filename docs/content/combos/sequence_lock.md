Sequence lock mode, when activated, will synchronize the sequence to a global clock. This ensures that manipulations to the sequence (such as jumping) will revert back to the intended beat position. Sequence lock mode will show `LOCK ON` when enabled and `LOCK OFF` when disabled. The sequence lock is enabled by default.
