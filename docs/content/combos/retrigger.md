Select a slice with **1-16** and then press another key on the **1-16** keypad to initiate a retrigger effect on the selected slice. The retrigger rate will depend on the second key press, with **1** being the fastest rate and **16** being the slowest rate.

If you want pitch up/down effects to be applied to the retriggering, you can enable the [Retrigger Setting](#retrigger-settings) under the effects (**A** + **15** in jump mode).
