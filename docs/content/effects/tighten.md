The Tighten effect uses a gate to cut off the audio towards the end of a step, based on the duration setting. This clipping of the ends helps create a more defined and tighter sound profile. 

The gate effect is a tool used in audio engineering to control the volume level of a signal. It works by allowing or blocking the passage of audio based on a set threshold. This can help eliminate unwanted noise or shape the dynamics of a sound.
