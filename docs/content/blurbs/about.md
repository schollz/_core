# About 

The zeptocore is an *[open-source](https://github.com/schollz/_core)* handheld device for playing with samples, featuring:

- stereo playback of 16-bit audio files @ 44.1 kHz sampling rate
- sd-card storage for up to 8 gigabytes of samples
- recalls up to 256 audio files (16 banks of 16 tracks)
- 16 different [effects](#effect-list) (saturate, fuzz, delay, reverb, etc...)
- single-cycle wavetable synthesizer
- realtime sequencer with optional quantization
- clock sync in (or midi sync with [ittybittymidi](https://ittybittymidi.com))
- optional clock [sync out](#sync-out)
- tiny built-in speaker
- powered by two AAA batteries or USB-C

### Goals

1. **Open-source**: The source code is publicly available at [https://github.com/schollz/_core](https://github.com/schollz/_core), allowing anyone to modify this device today or in the future.
2. **Low learning curve**: The device should be enjoyable without the need to read a manual, although reading the manual can enhance the experience.
3. **Unquantized**: By default, the sequencer does not enforce 4/4 time signatures.

### Non-Goals

1. **Similarity**: The intention is not for this device to resemble anything else. Some decisions are highly opinionated, but since it is completely open-source, you can modify the device as you wish.
2. **Audio synthesis**: The CPU is already quite taxed by the current system, and I believe that synthesis requires significantly more cycles to sound good.
3. **Polyphony**: This device only supports two voicesâ€”a monophonic sample voice and a monophonic bass voice. These voices are smoothly crossfaded, but the CPU limits the possibility of having more polyphony. (Consider syncing more devices together instead!)
