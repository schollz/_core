# Modes

There are three modes that can be activated within the zeptocore:

*Jump Mode* is the default mode that is activated when turning on the zeptocore or by pressing **A** + **B**. In this mode, the **1-16** keys are used to navigate through audio slices, create loops, or retrigger audio samples for dynamic performance effects.

*Mash Mode* is accessed by pressing **A** + **C** and transforms the **1-16** keys into toggles for activating or deactivating effects. This mode adds complexity and textures to a sample.

*Bass Mode* can be initiated with **A** + **D** and assigns bass notes to the **1-16** keys, allowing users to play melodic basslines directly from the device. This mode enables easy integration of speaker-shaking audio elements into the output.
