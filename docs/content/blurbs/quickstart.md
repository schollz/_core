Download a [one page PDF](/img/zeptocore_quickstart.pdf) of this guide for easy reference.

### on & off

To power on the device, toggle the switch on the top right to the "up" position. The device comes pre-loaded with several samples. A sample will start playing automatically.

 Navigate through the samples by pressing any of the `1-16` keys.

</figure>

 Experiment with retriggering samples by pressing and holding one `1-16` key and then pressing a different `1-16` key.



### volume & tempo

The `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` keys are used in combination with the knobs to adjust various settings.

</figure>

Adjust the [volume](#volume) by holding the `A` key (top left key) and turning `Knob Z` located on the right-hand side.

</figure>


Similarly, modify the [tempo](#tempo) by holding the `A` key and turning `Knob Y`.


### banks & samples

There are 16 banks of samples, with each bank capable of holding 16 samples. By default, you are in the first bank and the first sample. 

<figure class="imgcombo">
<img src="/img/change_samples.webp">

</figure>


To switch to a different bank and select a different sample, follow these steps: first, hold `B`, then while holding `B`, press `1-16` to choose a bank. Keep the `B` key pressed and then press another `1-16` button to select a sample within that bank.

## effects

The device powers up in `JUMP` mode, where pressing `1-16` allows you to navigate through samples. When in jump mode you can hold `A` and press any of the `1-16` to activate an effect.

There are [16 different effects](#effect-list) to choose from. 

## effect parameters & probabilities

Each effect can be customized with up to two parameters and features a probability setting. To adjust the effect parameters, enter `MASH` mode by pressing (`A` + `C`). While in `MASH` mode, press and hold the effect you wish to edit. For instance, hold down `2` to modify the `LOSS` effect. While holding the effect, use `Knob X` or `Knob Y` to tweak the parameters for that effect. Detailed information about each parameter can be found in the effect reference section below. For example, [loss](#loss) allows adjustments to "loss type" and "loss amount." To modify the likelihood of the effect occurring randomly, use `Knob Z`.


## adding samples & updating firmware

To add samples, power off the device and remove the microSD card. Samples must be pre-processed before uploading them directly to the SD card. You can utilize [the online tool](/tool) for sample processing or opt to [download the tool](#uploading-samples) for offline use. Updating the firmware is simple - download a new release and upload it using a USB-C cable. Follow the provided [instructions for uploading firmware](#uploading-firmware) to complete the process and install the new firmware.

## long guide
