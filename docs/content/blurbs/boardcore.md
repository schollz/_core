# boardcore

This is a breadboard variant of the Zeptocore. It has most of the same functionality, but instead of using the buttons on the handheld device, you can utilize your keyboard and a computer terminal. This version requires some knowledge of breadboarding, but it is ideal if you want to develop your ideas based on the firmware.

you can purchase the components directly [from my store](#buy) or you can buy them from Amazon.
