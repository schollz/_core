The zeptocore is a class-compliant MIDI device, which means it should work with any operating system that supports MIDI. However, some users have reported issues with Mac OS. Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- **Check the cable**: Make sure the MIDI cable is securely connected to both the zeptocore and your Mac using a USB A connector.  Currently it seems that MIDI communication will not work through a Thunderbolt bus or plugged via a USB-C to USB-C cable. 
- **Check the MIDI settings**: Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security` and click the the pop-menu next to "`Allow accessories to connect`" and choose "`Automatically When Unlocked`".
