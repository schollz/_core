To change samples using the buttons, follow these steps: hold **B** and press **1-16** to choose a bank. While still holding **B**, press another **1-16** to select the sample. 

Alternatively, you can change the sample by selecting a bank with a knob or by selecting a sample with a knob. For more information, refer to [changing banks with a knob](#change-banks-with-knob) and [changing samples with a knob](#change-samples-with-knob).
