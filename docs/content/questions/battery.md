I apologize for any inconvenience. When encountering issues due to low battery levels, I recommend first replacing both batteries with fresh ones. Try powering the device using USB-C to check if it resolves the issue. I also suggest using high-quality alkaline batteries instead of carbon zinc ones, as alkaline batteries maintain voltage better over time and are less likely to cause operational problems.
