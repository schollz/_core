Sorry! Sometimes the battery gets low and strange things happen. First, try changing both batteries to fresh ones, and then see if it works by powering with USB-C. I also recommend using good alkaline batteries instead of carbon zinc batteries - alkaline batteries hold voltage better than carbon zinc and are less likely to cause trouble when used over time.
