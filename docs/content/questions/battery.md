Sorry! Sometimes the battery gets low and strange things happen. First try changing both the batteries to fresh ones, and then also see if it works by powering with USB-C. Also, I recommend getting good alkaline batteries rather than carbon zinc batteries - the alkaline batteries hold a voltage better than carbon zinc and will be less prone to causing trouble when they are used for a period of time.
