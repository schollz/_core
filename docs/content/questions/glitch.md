I apologize for any issues you may be experiencing. The audio drops are likely related to the SD cards being used. Not all SD cards are equal, as some may have high latencies that can cause audio disruptions. Refer to [the answer to this question](#which-sd-card-can-i-use) to identify the best SD card for optimal performance. When glitches occur, the zeptocore can typically recover, producing varying glitch sounds. However, in rare cases, a restart may be necessary. The provided SD card should be suitable, but if you encounter ongoing issues, please inform me.
