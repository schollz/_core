If you purchased the zeptocore from me, I have made efforts to supply the best SD card available.

Please note that not all SD cards are equal. Terms like "high-speed," "A1," or "U3" on the card do not necessarily indicate its actual speed performance.

Below is a list of known good and bad cards:

### Known bad cards

Do *not* use these cards! They may appear to work, but they can cause spurious glitches.

- Lexar brand
- Kootion brand
- Sandisk Ultra
- Kingston brand
- 5% of JUANWE cards

### Known good cards

- Gigastone 16GB + 32GB
- SP Elite
- SanDisk Extreme
- Samsung EVO
- PNY Elite
- MicroCenter
