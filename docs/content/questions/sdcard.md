If you purchased the zeptocore from me, I have made efforts to supply the best SD card available.

Please note that not all SD cards are equal. Terms like "high-speed," "A1," or "U3" on the card do not necessarily indicate its actual speed performance.

Below is a list of known good and bad cards:

### Known bad cards

Do *not* use these cards! They may appear to work, but they can cause spurious glitches.

- Lexar brand
- Kootion brand
- Sandisk Ultra
- Kingston brand
- 5% of JUANWE cards

### Known good cards

- Gigastone 16GB + 32GB
- SP Elite
- SanDisk Ultra, SanDisk Extreme
- Samsung EVO
- PNY Elite
- MicroCenter

Here is my personal investigation into the cards and a comparison of the options available to me. The cards on the far left experience random dropouts, while the cards on the far right are deemed too slow. The cards in the middle are considered the best:
