# Ezeptocore Eurorack Module

---

## Long Description

The **Ezeptocore** is an **algorithmic breakbeat-focused sampler and sample mangler** for Eurorack modular systems. Developed through a collaboration between **Infinite Digits** and **Maneco Labs**, Ezeptocore streams audio directly from SD storage, allowing performers and producers to slice, chop, transform, and rhythmically re-sequence samples in real time.

At its core, Ezeptocore combines sample playback with a **Turing machine–inspired random sequencer (rungler)** that generates evolving slice patterns and rhythmic variation. This enables dynamic breakbeats, glitch textures, and constantly shifting grooves without repetitive programming. Clock synchronization, tap tempo, internal clock division, and retrigger logic make Ezeptocore tightly integrated with modular clock ecosystems.

Internally, Ezeptocore features a powerful real-time DSP engine with multiple creative effects including **delay, comb filtering, time-stretching, tape stop, reverse playback, saturation, fuzz distortion, bitcrush, beat repeat, resonant filtering, vinyl scratch, auto-pan, transient tightening, and sample expansion processing**. These effects can be combined with algorithmic sequencing to create constantly evolving rhythmic textures and aggressive sound design results.

With **16 sample banks**, a browser-based sample preparation tool, built-in trigger generation modes, and performance-oriented controls for pitch, volume, retrigger behavior, and FX modulation, Ezeptocore bridges traditional sampling workflows with generative modular performance. It functions equally well as a live breakbeat instrument, rhythmic sound design tool, and experimental modular sampler engine.

### DSP Effects Engine

Ezeptocore includes multiple integrated real-time DSP effects:

- **Delay effect** — tempo-synced rhythmic echo processing
- **Comb filter** — resonant tonal shaping and metallic textures
- **Time-stretch engine** — preserves rhythm timing while altering playback speed
- **Tape stop effect** — dramatic slowdown and pitch-drop transitions
- **Reverse playback mode** — reverse sample slicing and playback
- **Saturation processor** — analog-style harmonic enhancement
- **Fuzz distortion engine** — aggressive overdrive textures
- **Bitcrush effect** — sample rate and bit depth reduction for lo-fi textures
- **Beat repeat / stutter engine** — real-time loop and stutter effects on audio slices
- **Resonant filter** — lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch filtering with adjustable resonance
- **Scratch effect** — vinyl scratch simulation with LFO-modulated speed and direction
- **Auto-pan effect** — LFO-controlled stereo panning for spatial movement
- **Transient tightening processor** — punch enhancement and rhythmic clarity
- **Sample expansion effect** — dynamic spatial and envelope shaping

Multiple effects can be activated simultaneously for layered sound design.
