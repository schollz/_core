Normally, ectocore and zeptocore should not freeze. 

If you are encountering a freeze, you might first try to upload this [new firmware that disables overclocking](https://github.com/schollz/_core/releases/download/v6.3.2/ectocore_no_overclocking_v6.3.2.uf2).

If you still encounter a freeze, it would be helpful to know the following:

> What SD card are you using? If you are using a custom SD card, please try using the stock SD card to see if the issue persists. If it does, please answer the following questions.

> Were effects on or off during the freeze? Try turning off all effects (Break knob fully CCW) and see if the issue persists.

> Are you using custom samples or the stock samples? Try using the [stock samples](https://infinitedigits.co/zeptocore_default_samples_v6.zip) and see if the issue persists.

> Is it a particular sample that causes a freeze or any sample? If a particular sample, please provide the original sample if you can.

> What was the BPM set to?

If, however, you want to return the device, I completely understand. Please reach out to the seller for a return.
